# Netflix-Clone
Welcome to my Netflix clone project built using HTML and CSS!

In this project, I have recreated the user interface of Netflix using fundamental web technologies. The aim was to provide users with a similar browsing and viewing experience to the popular streaming platform. By leveraging HTML for structure and CSS for styling, I focused on mimicking the layout, design, and basic functionality of Netflix.

Features:

# Homepage Layout: Recreated the main layout of Netflix's homepage.
# Navigation Bar: Implemented a responsive navigation bar similar to Netflix.
# Content Sections: Structured content sections for different genres or categories.
# Responsive Design: Ensured the application is responsive and works across different screen sizes.

Note:- Here In This Project, I have given the pictures and video regarding the same project but in the code some where i used the links that is available on Netflix Website, you can also used these download stuff or you can go through the link also. Make sure to download a copy of these media for the future purpuse. 

Thanks-
ASHMIT SINGH
